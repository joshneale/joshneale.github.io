<h1>Hi, my name is Josh Neale</h1>

<p class="home">Allow me to introduce myself. I am studying for a degree in Music Performance at London College of Music,
and currently based in Southampton, England. I started producing more professionally while at college,
but have been playing drums since 2006.</p>

<p class="home">
This website is a portfolio of my skills and projects. I will use it to document projects I have been a part of,
shows and concerts I've played, and my up-to-date contact information.
(Head over to the <a href="contact.html">contact page </a>to find out how to get in touch).</p>
