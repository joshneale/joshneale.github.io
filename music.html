<h1>Here's my music</h1>

<p class="music">A selection of compositional projects completed as part of my education, for a
client or in my spare time. Each track has been put into context below to help you understand
what I was trying to achieve. If you have any questions about what I use to produce or how
I go about it then feel free to send me a message.</p>

<p class="music">I'm still in the process of uploading the tracks so why not have a look at
my <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/joshuaneale">SoundCloud </a>while you wait?</p>
