  <p><img class="float" src="/images/tama.jpg" style="float: right;" width="315" height="446" >Josh Neale is a kit player, percussionist and graduate of the London College of Music, having specialised in jazz.</p>

<p>With origins in brass bands, he has been fortunate enough to have toured Europe multiple times, and to swiftly progress into playing as part of a Big Band, notably Romsey Area Youth Jazz Orchestra who performed in Cork during it's 'Red Hot International Jazz Festival' in 2012.</p>

<p>Though experienced in studio and live recording, performing is his main passion, whether that’s on the main stage of Ealing Jazz Festival, or in a theatre pit. Now with recording credits such as The Skelton & Skinner Septet’s The Odd Couple, and several shows under his belt, such as West Side Story, Will Todd’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Half a Sixpence, Oliver, Rags and Bat Boy, he hopes to continue this wide array of musical projects alongside teaching at the Junior London College of Music and in association with Ealing Music Service.</p>
