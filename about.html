<h1>A bit about me</h1>

<p class="about">I have been playing drums since I was 10 years old (I'm 18 as of 2014).
Originally I wanted to play guitar so my Dad took me to a 'music school open day'
where I could try out guitar, drums and bass. I took to drums straight away.
I got my first drum kit a year later (and still have it to this day) and that's about the
time I joined the Hamble Area Youth Band, my local brass band.</p>

<p class="about>">From playing in HAYB and various school bands I went on to join
Hampshire County Youth Brass Band and Romsey Area Youth Jazz Ensemble. I learnt a great deal and gained
a lot of experience rehearsing, performing and touring with these bands and am therefore so
grateful for the opputunity.</p>
